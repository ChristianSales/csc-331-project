StockSeer is a fantasy game that allows aspiring investors to learn how to trade financial stocks.
The game supports trading activities and simulates a broker who pretends to execute trading
orders. This tool is for an investor who does not have too much time to do a thorough research on
all aspects of a particular company, neither do they have understanding and mastery over
financial number crunching. The application should leverage freely available financial
information and databases, in real time, to help make the game realistic for the would-be
investor.
